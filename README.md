# Balloon mode (A concept for now...)

![Sonic falling into a balloon](media/balloonlua2.png)

Just a Lua script that adds a functionality to SRB2 that creates a balloon in your place for helping you to reach higher places.

## But what it can do for you?

* *It can save **you** from enemies attacks.*

* *It can wait to you when you die on a netgame, if you **want** obviously.*

* *It can help you reach **secret** places.*

![Sonic watching pink waterfall wait what](media/secret.gif)

* *It can tell you whether you have **inverse** gravity.*

![fuckkk you ballooon shiiiitititit](media/gravflipped.gif)

* *It can't save you if you need **air** underwater.*

![bruhh balloons doesn't have air here huh, better...](media/underwater.gif)

* *It can't save you if you got a **irreversible** hurt.*
